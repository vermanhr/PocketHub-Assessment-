# Notes:
 •During the build test cases were failing so tried build with bypassing the test cases. 
 
 •	BuildKite was very new CI setup for me , considering limited knowledge and short time duration I have used all credentials inside the pipeline only otherwise if we should     always pass credentials through variables or any other secrets manger service
